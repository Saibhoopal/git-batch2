Compared to the plain ls command, this returns much more information.

You have, from left to right:

the file permissions (and if your system supports ACLs, you get an ACL flag as well)
the number of links to that file
the owner of the file
the group of the file
the file size in bytes
the file's last modified datetime
the file name
